# Yandex.Music.CLI


Forked from: https://github.com/Winster332/Yandex.Music.Api

## Abstract
Allows you to listen to music through Yandex integration in the terminal

Original status: lost (obsolete)

## My actions (my 2 cents) 

1. Lite bugfix (some try...catch added to avoid accident app halts...)

2. Simple CLI mode for music track search query (by track name)

## Description

Sorry, this is not for Universal Windows Platform yet... It's "classic" app based on .NET Core 3

Idk how to port this "lib/app" into UWP... and .NET Standard 1.4 :(

Note: This project was created as a proof-of-concept over a short amount of time. 
The code may not be perfect. It exists for demonstration and educational purposes. Feel free to fork this project!

## Coding "workbench"

1. Visual Studio 2022 (But VS 2017 compatibility remained, for Live WinPhone debugging, heh!)

2. .NET Core 3.1


## Test scenario

Compile

Start app

Authorize on Yandex.Music service

Make some track search, i.e. "Nothing else"

Choose 1 ("Metallica")

Enjoy the good sound :)
